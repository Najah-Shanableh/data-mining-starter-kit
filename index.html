Using clickstream technology, the modern advertiser can follow would-be customers as they browse online. These marketers are searching for clues about your preferences and shopping habits, evidence of your family composition, and even upcoming events in your life, all for the purposes of "personalization." On an individual level, Fitbits, Fuel bands, and Jawbone all allow us to monitor ourselves 24 hours a day, while 23andme gives us data about our genetic make-up. Not only do <i>we</i> consume personal data, but we <i>share</i> it with others on social media.

Marketing personalization combines disperate data about a single person or household: demographics, transactional histories, social media activities and clickstream. Personalizatin efforts require the ability to ingest and combine data from many sources across many formats. Graph databases like <a href="http://thinkaurelius.github.io/titan/">Titan</a> or <a href="http://neo4j.com/">neo4j</a> represent complex interactions as network graphs and analysts query the network with traversal patterns. Algorithms like mapreduce on the other hand, revolutionized the way we query <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_data">unstructured data</a>, like text and weblogs.</p></section></section><section data-transition-speed="fast"><h2>We need new tools</h2><p>In the context of big, heterogeneous data, the number of candidate features is too large to explore with traditional analysis techniques.

Realistically, data cleaning and exploratory analysis will occupy the vast majority of your time with the rest left over for model discovery. Model deployment is optional and depends on the result of the first three steps. After completing the analysis you might find that long-term adoption of your model isn't worthwhile.</p></section><section data-transition-speed="fast"><h2>Additional definitions</h2><blockquote>Data mining is the extraction of implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful information from data. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Data-Mining-Practical-Techniques-Management/dp/0123748569">Witten, Frank and Hall</a></blockquote><blockquote>The most commonly accepted definition of “data mining” is the discovery of “models” for data."

Generally the field of statistics is concerned with the analysis and interpretation of data, while the field of machine learning is primarily focused on prediction. Machine learning is less concerned with interpretation and validity of statistical assumptions (to the extent that they don't negatively influence the model's ability to predict).</p></section><section data-transition-speed="fast"><p>To learn more about the different paradigms of inferential statistics and machine learning I highly recommend <a href="http://faculty.smu.edu/tfomby/eco5385/lecture/Breiman%27s%20Two%20Cultures%20paper.pdf">Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures</a> by Leo Breiman.</p></section></section><section data-transition-speed="fast"><h2>Machine Learning</h2><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">Machine learning</a> is a discipline originating in artificial intelligence that creates and investigates algorithms that help machines <i>learn</i> from data.

The key difference is that in machine learning, we'll judge our model quality by assessing its ability to predict on hold-out data, rather than through goodness-of-fit metrics like $ R^2 $ or AIC.</p></section><section data-transition-speed="fast"><h3>Limitations of data mining</h3><p>Like any analytical technique, and arguably more so than traditional analysis, data mining has limitations:<ul><li>many patterns are uninteresting</li><li>patterns can be coincidental or a result of sampling bias</li><li>data are almost always untidy or missing</li></ul></p><p>How do these limitations influence the inpretation and application of the results of a data mining process?

Then we started mixing in all these ads for things we knew pregnant women would never buy, so the baby ads looked random. We’d put an ad for a lawn mower next to diapers. We’d put a coupon for wineglasses next to infant clothes. That way, it looked like all the products were chosen by chance.</blockquote></section><section data-transition-speed="fast"><p>... and then of course they say this dehumanizing thing.</p><blockquote>And we found out that as long as a pregnant woman thinks she hasn’t been spied on, she’ll use the coupons.
