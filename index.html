Using clickstream technology, the modern advertiser can follow would-be customers as they browse online. These marketers are searching for clues about your preferences and shopping habits, evidence of your family composition, and even upcoming events in your life, all for the purposes of "personalization." On an individual level, Fitbits, Fuel bands, and Jawbone all allow us to monitor ourselves 24 hours a day, while 23andme gives us data about our genetic make-up. Not only do <i>we</i> consume personal data, but we <i>share</i> it with others on social media.

Graph databases like <a href="http://thinkaurelius.github.io/titan/">Titan</a> or <a href="http://neo4j.com/">neo4j</a> represent complex interactions as network graphs and analysts query the network with traversal patterns.

Then we started mixing in all these ads for things we knew pregnant women would never buy, so the baby ads looked random. We’d put an ad for a lawn mower next to diapers. We’d put a coupon for wineglasses next to infant clothes.

The coefficients also give a rough indication of what variables contribute most to the predicted value, which can be helpful in understanding causal mechanisms and for variable selection.</p></section><section data-transition-speed="fast"><h2>Ease of implementation</h2><p>Virtually all programming languages have implementations for linear regression, so they can be applied across many applications.</p></section><section data-transition-speed="fast"><h2>Powerful</h2><p>In prediction settings, linear models can outperform more complex nonlinear techniques, particularly when working with small training sets or sparse data. This is because regression is an averaging technique, making it less sensitive to missingness and extreme values.</p></section><section data-transition-speed="fast"><h2>Flexible</h2><p>Even in situations where linearity assumptions fail, regression can be applied on transformations of variables such as logarithms. </p></section><section data-transition-speed="fast"><h2>Mathematical foundations</h2><p>Let's walk through the foundations of regression with just one explanatory variable/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariate">covariate</a>. Regression with just one covariate is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression">simple linear regression</a>.

Each $y_i$ is an observed value of the outcome variable. $\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_i$ is the estimated, or expected, $y_i$ value. So when we minimize the sum of squared errors we're making $(observed - expected)^2$ as close to 0 as possible.</p></section><section data-transition-speed="fast"><section data-transition-speed="fast"><h2>Assumptions</h2><p>To safely apply linear regression without fear of weird results, some assumptions must be met:<ol><li>Linearity between the outcome and covariates</li><li>Independence of the errors (no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrelation">autocorrelation</a>)</li><li>Constant variance (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoscedasticity">homoscedasticity</a>) of the errors</li><li>Normality of errors</li></ol></p><p>We might violate some assumptions and it's application-dependent whether we should be concerned about those violations.</p></section><section data-transition-speed="fast"><h2>Diagnostic plots</h2><p>In R, if you plot a linear model object, it'll give you a nice collection of diagnostic plots for assessing model assumptions.</p><pre><code data-trim="data-trim" contenteditable="contenteditable" class="r">model = lm(rentals ~ crossing, data = data)

Unfortunately that's so many predictors that it's virtually impossible to interpret our results. Not only that, but to use a model that big for prediction would be a nightmare. It means that for every candidate station, we'd have to plug in 117 variables about the location and weather into the model to get the expected number of rentals.

In a data mining context we sometimes have data where $p >> n$. An example of this from the biomedical science is microarray technology. One tissue sample can produce over 50,000 observations making $p$ orders of magnitude larger than $n$. </p></section><section data-transition-speed="fast"><h2></h2><p>The "curse of dimensionality" is not a problem of high-dimensional data, but a joint problem of the data and the algorithm being applied. It arises when the algorithm does not scale well to high-dimensional data, typically due to needing an amount of time or memory that is exponential in the number of dimensions of the data.</p></section></section><section data-transition-speed="fast"><h2>Improve predictions</h2><figure style="width: 35%" class="right"><img src="images/bias_variance.png" style="width: 100%"/><figcaption><a href="http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html">Understanding the Bias-Variance Tradeoff</a></figcaption></figure><p>Besides reducing the size of the unwieldy model, we also want to improve prediction accuracy.

Your model building and error estimation procedure is then repeated $n$ times. After completing a 5-fold cross-validation you'd have 5 error estimates and can average to obtain a robust estimate of the prediction error.</p></section><section data-transition-speed="fast"><h2>Shrinkage</h2><p>In our model of daily rentals, many predictors had quite small coefficients. For example, the coefficient on the number of stop signs, <i>stops</i>, is about -0.09. Since the outcome is rentals per day, a coeffcient this small means we'd need about 10 additional stop signs to reduce the expected rentals by 1. In other words, it's not contributing much to our predicted values.</p></section><section data-transition-speed="fast"><section data-transition-speed="fast"><h2>High variance</h2><p>You might have observed some coefficients with high variance. We have a lot of predictors, and when many are correlated, we violate the assumption of independence between predictors and the result is often high variance. A large positive coefficient on one predictor can be canceled by a similarly large negative coefficient on its correlate. Shrinking coefficients alleviates this problem, in part because some predictors will shrink to zero and drop out. </p></section><section data-transition-speed="fast"><h2>Lower variance, higher bias</h2><p>Applying the ridge regression penalty has the effect of shrinking the estimates toward zero which reduces variance but introduces bias.</p></section></section><section data-transition-speed="fast"><h2>Ridge regression</h2><p>Ridge regression <i>shrinks</i> regression coefficients by penalizing based on the coefficient size. In ordinary least squares, we picked $\beta$s that minimize our squared errors.
