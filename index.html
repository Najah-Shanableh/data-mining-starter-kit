Using clickstream technology, the modern advertiser can follow would-be customers as they browse online. These marketers are searching for clues about your preferences and shopping habits, evidence of your family composition, and even upcoming events in your life, all for the purposes of "personalization." On an individual level, Fitbits, Fuel bands, and Jawbone all allow us to monitor ourselves 24 hours a day, while 23andme gives us data about our genetic make-up. Not only do <i>we</i> consume personal data, but we <i>share</i> it with others on social media.

Marketing personalization combines disperate data about a single person or household: demographics, transactional histories, social media activities and clickstream. Personalizatin efforts require the ability to ingest and combine data from many sources across many formats. Graph databases like <a href="http://thinkaurelius.github.io/titan/">Titan</a> or <a href="http://neo4j.com/">neo4j</a> represent complex interactions as network graphs and analysts query the network with traversal patterns.

It turns out, for example, that over 85% of Americans can be identified from publicly available records using just three pieces of information: five-digit zip code, birth date, and sex. Don’t know the zip code?—over half of Americans can be identified from just city, birth date, and sex.</p><footer><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Data-Mining-Kaufmann-Management-Systems-ebook/dp/B004H1TB1W/">Witten, Frank and Hall</a></footer></blockquote></section><section data-transition-speed="fast"><h2>It needn't be demographic data</h2><blockquote><p>Netflix released 100 million records of movie ratings with their dates. To their surprise, it turned out to be quite easy to identify people in the database and thus discover all the movies they had rated. For example, if you know approximately when a person in the database rated six movies and you know the ratings, you can identify 99% of the people in the database. By knowing only two movies with their ratings and dates, give or take three days, nearly 70% of people can be identified. From just a little information about your friends you can determine all the movies they have rated on Netflix.</p><footer><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Data-Mining-Kaufmann-Management-Systems-ebook/dp/B004H1TB1W/">Witten, Frank and Hall</a></footer></blockquote></section><section data-transition-speed="fast"><p>“If we send someone a catalog and say, ‘Congratulations on your first child!’ and they’ve never told us they’re pregnant, that’s going to make some people uncomfortable,” Pole told me. “We are very conservative about compliance with all privacy laws. But even if you’re following the law, you can do things where people get queasy.”</p><p>She was high school age, a fact that, presumably, Target was aware of. Why then did they proceed with the mailer?</p></section><section data-transition-speed="fast"><p>“With the pregnancy products, though, we learned that some women react badly,” the executive said. “Then we started mixing in all these ads for things we knew pregnant women would never buy, so the baby ads looked random. We’d put an ad for a lawn mower next to diapers. We’d put a coupon for wineglasses next to infant clothes. That way, it looked like all the products were chosen by chance.</p><p>“And we found out that as long as a pregnant woman thinks she hasn’t been spied on, she’ll use the coupons. She just assumes that everyone else on her block got the same mailer for diapers and cribs. As long as we don’t spook her, it works.”</p></section><section data-transition-speed="fast"><h2>Profiling with data</h2><p>Find and example of police using demographic data to target patroling. </p><p>The concern raised by many is that if you look at so much data, and you try to find within it activities that look like terrorist behavior, are you not going to find many innocent activities – or even illicit activities that are not terrorism – that will result in visits from the police and maybe worse than just a visit? The answer is that it all depends on how narrowly you define the activities that you look for. Statisticians have seen this problem in many guises and have a theory, which we introduce in the next section.</p></section><section data-transition-speed="fast"><section data-transition-speed="fast"><h2>The Bonferroni principle</h2><p>If we are willing to view as an interesting feature of data something of which many instances can be expected to exist in random data, then we cannot rely on such features being significant. This observation limits our ability to mine data for features that are not sufficiently rare in practice. </p></section><section data-transition-speed="fast"><h2>Bonferroni correction</h2><p>Describe the statistical rationale</p><p>Calculate the expected number of occurrences of the events you are looking for, on the assumption that data is random. If this number is signifi- cantly larger than the number of real instances you hope to find, then you must expect almost anything you find to be bogus, i.e., a statistical artifact rather than evidence of what you are looking for. This observation is the informal statement of Bonferroni’s principle.</p></section></section><section data-transition-speed="fast"><h2>Ethical behavior requires constant diligence </h2><p>The ethical consequences of data mining isn't a one-time consideration.

Since we will be tuning models using resampling methods, a random sample of the training set may result in some predictors with more than one unique value to become a zero-variance predictor. These so-called "near zero-variance predictors" can cause numerical problems during resampling for some models, such as linear regression.</p></section><section><h2>handling zero-variance predictors</h2><p>Identify near zero variance predictors with the function nearZeroVar.
