Don’t know the zip code?—over half of Americans can be identified from just city, birth date, and sex. - data mining book</blockquote></section><section><p>Netflix, an online movie rental service, released 100 million records of movie ratings (from 1 to 5) with their dates. To their surprise, it turned out to be quite easy to identify people in the database and thus discover all the movies they had rated. For example, if you know approximately when (give or take two weeks) a person in the database rated six movies and you know the ratings, you can identify 99% of the people in the database. By knowing only two movies with their ratings and dates, give or take three days, nearly 70% of people can be identified. From just a little information about your friends (or enemies) you can determine all the movies they have rated on Netflix.</p></section><section data-transition-speed="fast"><h2>Profiling with data</h2><p>Find and example of police using demographic data to target patroling. </p><p>The concern raised by many is that if you look at so much data, and you try to find within it activities that look like terrorist behavior, are you not going to find many innocent activities – or even illicit activities that are not terrorism – that will result in visits from the police and maybe worse than just a visit? The answer is that it all depends on how narrowly you define the activities that you look for. Statisticians have seen this problem in many guises and have a theory, which we introduce in the next section.</p></section><section data-transition-speed="fast"><section data-transition-speed="fast"><h2>The Bonferroni principle</h2><p>If we are willing to view as an interesting feature of data something of which many instances can be expected to exist in random data, then we cannot rely on such features being significant.

This observation is the informal statement of Bonferroni’s principle.</p></section></section><section data-transition-speed="fast"><h2>Ethical behavior requires constant diligence </h2><p>The ethical consequences of data mining isn't a one-time consideration.
